# 👋 Hi, I'm Vijaya Sankaran K

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an engineering enthusiast with a strong foundation in **Verilog HDL**, **VLSI Design**, and **Digital Architecture**.
I enjoy building and analyzing efficient hardware systems, with a special interest in **approximate computing**, **low-power digital design**, and **parallel prefix adders**.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

- 🧠 **VLSI Circuit Design** – Exploring advanced parallel prefix adder architectures.
- ⚡ **Approximate Computing** – Designing logic circuits optimized for energy-efficiency and performance.
- 🖥️ **Verilog-based Hardware Modules** – From ALUs to pipelined multipliers and beyond.

## ✅ Completed Project

### 🎯 Design and Analysis of 8-bit Approximate Parallel Prefix Adders

**Description:**  
This project involves the Verilog design and functional analysis of **exact and approximate 8-bit Kogge-Stone and Ladner-Fischer adders**.
Approximate techniques were inspired by recent research (APPAs methodology) to reduce logic complexity while tolerating minor computational errors.

**Highlights:**
- Exact & approximate versions implemented from scratch.
- Simulation using ModelSim and testbenches for 10,000 input vectors.
- MATLAB scripts used for error metric calculation: **ER, MED, MRED, NMED**.
- Results show trade-offs in **accuracy vs area/power** – useful for low-power VLSI systems.

## 🌱 Learning and Building

I’m currently:
- Expanding into **low-power approximate multipliers**
- Designing a **5-stage RISC processor in Verilog**
- Working on a **modular ALU with pipelining and control logic**

## 🌿 Philosophy

I strive to integrate **technical depth** with **clarity and purpose**, not just in circuits but in life. 
My long-term goal is to create and share designs that are not only efficient but also **serve a greater good**, free from material excess.
